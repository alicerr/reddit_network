There are libertarians who believe in the right to own guns AND use drugs. You've never met someone who is pro-choice and pro-capital punishment? It's more common than you think. What about conservatives who try to criminalize abortion, yet could care less what happens to anyone after they are born?    The drug laws are not necessary to keep \"chaos and anarchy\" from taking over. You think if people can legally smoke weed or do some shrooms there will be rioting and looting in the streets? Get real.   Are you for prohibition of alcohol? Because that causes you to make decisions you normally wouldn't that could harm others. If you're against reforming drug laws, but want to allow people to drink, you're a hypocrite.	t3_28rkks	cie7k3x	t5_2cneq	1403463347	Sun Jun 22 14:55:47 EDT 2014	1403492147	Sun Jun 22 22:55:47 EDT 2014	The War on Drugs Has Failed, So Let's Shut it Down	politics	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null

Or is it the other way around.  &gt;And after fighting so hard to build a new government, do you think they constantly wanted individuals trying to overthrow it?  Yeah, I do.  They overthrew a government themselves, it's not really a distant possibility that they would be suspect of government and want to implement progressive measures at making sure the governments stayed within the best interests of the people.  &gt;My understanding is they wanted the states to be able to fight back if necessary using their well-regulated militias.

Many on the left deny the greatest tool we have to produce zero carbon electricity, nuclear power.  I'd agree with this criticism, but I'd also note that republicans haven't actually done much of anything significant to advance nuclear power, either. Which isn't to say that they've done *nothing*, mind you.  The problem is that republicans aren't an effective pro-nuclear party: they're ineffectively pro-nuclear, and a *very* effective pro-coal/oil party. As a result I don't think there's actually any climate change risk on a party basis (though individual democrats from conservative states might not be much different on the issue).	t3_28sr5p	cie7dgv	t5_2cneq	1403462926	Sun Jun 22 14:48:46 EDT 2014	1403491726	Sun Jun 22 22:48:46 EDT 2014	Krugman: The Loneliness of the Non-Crazy Republican	politics	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null
